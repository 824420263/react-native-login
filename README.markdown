## react-native login

[Blog post about integrating Facebook SDK with react-native here](http://brentvatne.ca/facebook-login-with-react-native/)

Check out the example gif below (sorry it's a bit heavy) to see it in action. Note that it is in the simulator so it uses the browser for Facebook auth; it will use the Facebook app if it is available. Video background is implemented in `RCTVideo` `RCTVideoManager` `VideoContentModes` `VideoResizeMode` `VideoStylePropTypes` and `RCTVideo.ios.js`.
