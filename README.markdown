## react-native login

[Blog post about integrating Facebook SDK with react-native here](http://brentvatne.ca/facebook-login-with-react-native/).

*Note*: To get this project running, you need to install the [Facebook SDK for iOS](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/ios)! 

Check out the example gif below (sorry it's a bit heavy) to see it in action. Note that it is in the simulator so it uses the browser for Facebook auth; it will use the Facebook app if it is available. Video background is implemented with [react-native-video](https://github.com/brentvatne/react-native-video), and gradient for the button with [react-native-linear-gradient](https://github.com/brentvatne/react-native-linear-gradient).
